CATCHTTMM measures time in a new way just with a dot, a circle, a thick line and the color.

Construction and reading

CATCHTMM consists of a grid of dots for catching time. From the left, there are two rows of 6 white dots, which will fill up with hours. The number of full dots represents the hour (one circle - one hour). As time fills up, circles appear from the bottom to the top, row by row. On the right there is a group of 60 colored dots to indicate minutes (6 rows of 10 dots). Minutes fill the grid points appearing horizontally. After ten minutes, the dots will turn into a thick line. Such a visual construction of time allows to read current time in the blink of an eye.

Time of day

Today we determine time by referring to the sun, hence the designation AM or PM. CATCHTTMM proposes a new division of the time of the day, which combines the change of light with the human activity circle during the day. The day has 7 color states, which can be seen by the color of the minutes.
